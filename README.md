A Dart package for forest growth simulation using the 3-PG process-based model.

This is a port of the [r3PG](https://github.com/trotsiuk/r3PG) model, written in Fortran95. I have no experience programming in Fortran, and the port might contain errors. Contributions and bug reports are more than welcome.
